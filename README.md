# p53_TAD_dynamics
Collection of jupyter notebooks and sample data for the calculations as well as movies of MD simulations in relation to the manuscript 'Hierarchically ordered multi-timescale structural dynamics of the intrinsically disordered p53 transactivation domain', DOI: XXX.

## notebooks

* Derivation of the spectral density function from MD simulation trajectories
* Calculation of relaxation dispersion (RD) spectrum from chemical shift time series pedicted from an MD trajectory (SPARTA+)
* Detection of transient stable structures
* Bayesian fit of a stretched CPMG function to the RD spectra predicted from MD trajectories using pymc

## Sample data

* A short MD trajecotry with a starting topology and a chemical shift time trace.

## MD trajecotry movies

* Movie S1: Super slow motion movie of a sample MD simulation trajectory of the p53 P27A mutant. Shown is the trace of the backbone (grey), with helix1 highlighted in cyan, helix 2 in orange, and the N-terminal in yellow. A total of 100 ns is shown (2.5 ns/second).
* Movie S2: Slow motion movie of a sample MD simulation trajectory of the p53 P27A mutant. Coloring as in S1; a total of 3 µs is shown (25 ns/second).
* Movie S3: Movie of a sample MD simulation trajectory of the p53 P27A mutant. Coloring as in S1; a total of 10 µs is shown in slow motion (250 ns/second).
